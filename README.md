# RShade  
 
![warcraft shade](https://github.com/gingray/rshade/raw/master/shade.jpg)

Ruby Shade or RShade gem to help you to reveal what lines of code are used in program execution.
  
```ruby
trace = RShade::Trace.new  
trace.reveal do  
  #your code here
end
trace.show
#rspec
 rshade_reveal do
   #code here
 end 

```
## Example
I've took example from https://github.com/spree/spree code base. Wrap code to take a look what code is in use when you save variant.
On such huge codebase as spree it's helpful to know what callbacks are triggered and so on.
```ruby
  context '#cost_currency' do
    context 'when cost currency is nil' do
      before { variant.cost_currency = nil }

      it 'populates cost currency with the default value on save', focus: true do
        rshade_reveal do
          variant.save!
        end
        expect(variant.cost_currency).to eql 'USD'
      end
    end
  end
```
Below is example how output will look like.
As you can see all code that have been in use is printed.
